2. Adaptive Window Size:

Dynamically adjust the window_size of the assignment history based on recent fairness or variance, making the system more or less sensitive to recent changes.
3. Experience Level Rebalancing:

If the ratio of beginners to experienced participants changes significantly, adjust pairing logic or selection probabilities to maintain balanced learning opportunities.
4. Parameter Search/Meta-Optimization:

Occasionally try random or grid search for parameters (alpha, beta, etc.) and keep those that improve fairness or performance metrics.
5. Override Decay Customization:

Make the override decay rate adaptive: decay faster if the system is stable, slower if fairness is poor.
6. Anomaly Pattern Learning:

Track which participants are frequently flagged as anomalies and adjust their base weights or selection logic accordingly.
7. Logging Analysis for Trends:

Periodically analyze the log file for trends (e.g., using pandas or numpy) and use this analysis to trigger parameter changes or alerts.
8. Automated Experience Promotion:

implement the above. make sure do add modularity from the beginning and always write out the complete code
